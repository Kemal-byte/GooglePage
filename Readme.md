# CS50's Web Programming - First assignment

## Objectives

Create three different pages, index page which is the default google search browser, google images page and lastly advanced search page. Use creative tools and css to
resemble the original google pages. 

### What is missing from the project

1. in the advanced search page, select attribute isn't formatted correctly, this is mainly, default select attribute is not supported to be changed. So in order to change it's styling I need to create a new custom made drop down menu.
2. Mobile responsiveness should be checked.



### Current obstacles

The advanced search page become way longer than I have anticipated, I should find a way to hide the options so it doesn't looks like a long read book.
